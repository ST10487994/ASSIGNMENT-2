The purpose of this Flashcard quiz app as created as a fun and interactive way to help users,especially students-to test their knowledge through a simple true/false quiz format.  i  t supports active learning in a fun , simple way and gives immediate feedback to help users reflect on their understanding.                                      DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS                                                                                                                                                       The app focuses on clarity and ease of use: welcome screen which is a clean start with a "start quiz" button,a quiz screen where users answer true/false questions in a flashcard format and a score screen that shows the user's results,provides brief feedback,and offers an option to restart or review.                                         Design-wise,focus was on clarity,consistency and responsiveness.I used ConstraintLayout to ensure the app looks good on different screen sizes,and kept the interface clean with minimal distractions to support smooth navigation and focus.For the development,I used GitHub to managebthe code and track progress through commits.GitHub actions were intergrated to automate tasks like build validation and error checks,ensuring code stability with every update.
